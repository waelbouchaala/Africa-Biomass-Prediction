# Africa-Biomass-Prediction
In this challenge, the objective is to predict biomass in shaded regions in Cote d’Ivoire based on GEDI, Sentinel-2 
and ground truth biomass data. Remote monitoring of the increase of biomass will help measure the impact of reforestation 
efforts in Cote d’Ivoire as well as detect the degradation of forests due to cocoa.
